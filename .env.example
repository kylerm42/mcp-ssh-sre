# SSH Connection Configuration

# SSH server address
# Examples:
#   - localhost (when running on the same machine as the SSH server)
#   - unraid.local (hostname)
#   - 192.168.1.100 (IP address)
SSH_HOST=unraid.local

# SSH port (default: 22)
SSH_PORT=22

# SSH username (should be a dedicated read-only user)
# See DEPLOYMENT.md for creating a secure SSH user
SSH_USERNAME=mcp-readonly

# Path to SSH private key
# Supports tilde expansion: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_mcp
# Or absolute paths: /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa_mcp
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/id_rsa_mcp

# Alternative: SSH password authentication (not recommended for production)
# SSH_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Command execution timeout in milliseconds (default: 15000 = 15 seconds)
# Increase for long-running commands like database dumps
COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS=15000

# Maximum consecutive command failures before circuit breaker opens (default: 3)
# When circuit breaker is open, commands will fail immediately to prevent retry loops
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES=3
